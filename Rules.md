	1.	Maintain a clear, consistent folder structure; split code into small, focused components/modules.
	2.	Preserve existing behavior: new features or bug fixes must not break current functionality (backward compatible).
	3.	Don’t change UI unless explicitly requested. UI-only changes require a separate approval.
	4.	Write high-quality, reusable, efficient code with clear names and minimal duplication.
    5.  Use a predictable folder layout
    6.  Each component/module should do one job and be as small as reasonable (single responsibility).
